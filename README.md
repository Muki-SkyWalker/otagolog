OtagoLog
============

A library for building ultra fast Scala servers with Netty and the Disruptor.

*Note*: this project requires Java 7.

Expected questions
-------------------

'Why OtagoLog?'

I named the project after the Otago Peninsula, a beautiful place in New Zealand which
I visited a long time ago. 'Log' because the project uses ordered logs for storage and
consistency.

'When is it ready?'

I don't know.
